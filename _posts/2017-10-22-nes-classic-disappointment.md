## It started at 7 AM

I broke down and decided to take a shot at getting the [NES Classic](http://www.nintendo.com/nes-classic/), partly out of nostalgia and partly because I was feeling nerdy.  I was out of country at the time of the [discontinuation announcement](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/nintendo-discontinuing-nes-classic-mistake/), and thought if I was going to get one now would be about the only time.

So I stood in line at a nearby Target with 8 other people, hoping to get a chance at the limited supply.  This happened two more times at Targets in my area (New England) before I threw in the towel.  Queuing for hours at a time is not my kind of thing.

## What is a nerd to do?

Well, you could try your hand at <s>the scalper's market</s> eBay, but given I'm also not one to drop $300 on a glorified emulator, I resolved to do what any self-respecting computer scientist would do: **build one, of course!** How? With a Raspberry Pi and some determination.  The folks over at How-To Geek have a lovely guide on [How To Build Your Own NES Classic With a Raspberry Pi and RetroPie](https://www.howtogeek.com/286842/how-to-build-your-own-nes-classic-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-retropie/) which I plan to follow.

All said and done, I spent more money than I wanted.  The NES Classic goes for $60 off the shelf (legitimately), and I've been set back $130 for all the parts (Raspberry Pi 3, power supply, 32GB micro SD card, custom NES case, and 2 usb controllers).  I justify this cost to myself by saying that I'll have double the gaming capacity than the NES Classic -- The RetroPie platform affords emulation for all sorts of systems, from NES to 64, sega, playstation, etc.  So it's FYNE.
 
Until then, I eagerly await all the parts.  Updates to follow.
