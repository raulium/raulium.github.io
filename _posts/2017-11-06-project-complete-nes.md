### Or How I Made My Own NES Classic

You can see my original post [here](http://harnasch.com/diy/project-complete-nes/).

So my [Mini NES Raspberry Pi case](https://www.etsy.com/listing/212989839/3d-printed-nes-inspired-raspberry-pi) finally arrived, and I couldn't be more thrilled with it:

The case took a little extra work to get put together (it helps to remove the SD card -- my bad), but the finished product is quite nice.  I'm really happy with the build quality of the 3D print job, and was pleasantly surprised at how strong the material actually is.  The supplied wood screws looked a little big and had me wondering if I was going to split the plastic.  But no, it all worked out perfectly.
